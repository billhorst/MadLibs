	<h3>Ten Thousand Years of {{word.adjective | capitalize}} {{word.ingVerb | capitalize}}!</h3>
	<p>While flying {{gender.possDet}} spaceship by Planet Spork-a-{{word.noun2}}, a {{gender.noun}} named {{word.properName}} comes across a small planet of miniature {{word.pluralAnimal}} {{word.ing_verb}}. Having been travelling for {{word.number}} months through space, {{gender.subj}} was very tired. Sensing this, the {{word.animal | capitalize}} King approaches {{word.properName}} and offers {{gender.obj}} a place to stay for the night as long as {{gender.subj}} continued {{word.adjective}} {{word.ingVerb}} with the rest of the {{word.adjective2}} {{word.pluralAnimal}}. {{gender.subj | capitalize}} agrees and they give {{gender.obj}} a room.</p>
	<p>{{gender.subj | capitalize}} enjoys {{word.adjective}} {{word.ingVerb}} with the {{word.pluralAnimal}} so much so that weeks turn into months and months turn into years. {{gender.subj | capitalize}} finds out that as long as {{gender.subj}}'s {{word.adjective}} {{word.ingVerb}}, {{gender.subj}} doesn't age.</p>
	<p>When {{gender.subj}} decides that it's time to return home, {{gender.subj}} finds that {{gender.possDet}} spaceship has fallen into disrepair and needs a piece of {{word.noun}} which only floats by every 10,000 years. All {{gender.subj}} can do is continue {{word.adjective}} {{word.ingVerb}} in the middle of the {{word.area}}. What will {{gender.subj}} do?</p>

	<p>Only two years pass since {{gender.possDet}} pet {{word.animal}} got stuck in a blender and passed away.
