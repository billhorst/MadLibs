<h1>This app is for the writer who needs help coming up with a new story. It will prompt you for certain word types and then generate stories of different genres using the words you input.</h1>
<h1>First, you'll choose the gender of your story's main character. Then, you can input whatever words you want based on the prompts you're given. If you can't think of a word, use the "Random Word" button to generate one for you. If you just can't be bothered to do any of that, just click the "Fill in all fields with random words" button. But then 10% of any sales of your book goes to me :)</h1>
<h1>After filling in the words, click one of the genres at the bottom to read your story. You can also click the other story buttons to see how the same words fit into a different genre. (In other words, you don't have to re-enter your words to see other stories.)</h1>
